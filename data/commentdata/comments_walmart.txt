I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

Funny you reply to others but not me, who was told once again by a supervisor yesterday that yes I am owed the refund but there is nothing she could do for me due to system constraints. That is definitely not my issue, so someone better start working on getting a check made out for $28.37 to me and put it in the mail.

I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN and will go out of my way to avoid your stores!!!!! I have been dealing with an erroneous charge on my credit card for 4 MONTHS NOW! I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!! I have no problem taking you to small claims count just out of principle!

I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!
