I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

Funny you reply to others but not me, who was told once again by a supervisor yesterday that yes I am owed the refund but there is nothing she could do for me due to system constraints. That is definitely not my issue, so someone better start working on getting a check made out for $28.37 to me and put it in the mail.

I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN and will go out of my way to avoid your stores!!!!! I have been dealing with an erroneous charge on my credit card for 4 MONTHS NOW! I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!! I have no problem taking you to small claims count just out of principle!

I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN and will go out of my way to avoid your stores!!!!! I have been dealing with an erroneous charge on my credit card for 4 MONTHS NOW! I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed.

I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money!

I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed.

I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN and will go out of my way to avoid your stores!!!!! I have been dealing with an erroneous charge on my credit card for 4 MONTHS NOW! I have talked to countless Customer Service Reps, at least 4 Supervisors, and a couple of people in the \"Corporate Office.\" And now to top it all off...I just checked my credit card (after waiting another 7 days for it to \"process through the system\") and not only find that my refund ONCE AGAIN did not go though, but now I have another fraudulent charge from you guys! I need this rectified and I need it done NOW! I currently do not live in the US, so every time I have to call you guys I have to eat through my minutes I pay for....costing me even more money! I tried to resolve the issue before I left, but I called several times and was told the refund was being process and to check again in 7 days....and of course the refund was never processed. At this point you OWE ME $46.72. Someone better get on the ball withe this ASAP.. This is beyond ridiculous and should have never happened! Oh and of course your e-mail me page on the website just takes you in a loop and never gives you an option to actually e-mail. I don't care how many times you try to ignore me with phone calls, e-mails, etc. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY $46.72...it will be refunded back if it's the last thing I do!!

Pls do not commit a delivery time if you cannot honor it.. also pls do not take customer's time for granted by hanging up the call without giving a proper response!!", "2016-07-15T14:04:42+0000", "159616034235_10154463822269236"], ["10154463822269236_10154470164604236", "Walmart.com can give me an answer ...I should have come yesterday the Order #4611617-163059 6 days ago I made the purchase. 2 days the promise ...

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.

I found a pair of Levi's and on my way to the register I  also grabbed a package of panties. \nAt the register I was behind a young family- when I heard the dad question the price of a batman t-shirt- he couldn't believe that the t-shirt was 36 dollars- neither could I. Meanwhile- I was flagged over to another register to be rung up.  After she rung my two items up and told me the total- I- like that dad - had questions. It seems that Kohls charges 24 dollars for a package of 4 fruit of the loom panties. These exact same panties are 9 dollars and change at Walmart.  The cashier assured me that the price was correct. Next- the Levi's- they were on a table with sale signs all over it- there was also a sign that said bootcut jeans were 29.99. I was informed that my Levi's did not qualify for the sale. That they were not one of the included styles. Then why place them on the sale table? \nThe cashier asked if I  wanted to look for another pair of jeans- a pair that qualified for the sale. I wanted the jeans I picked out. The back pockets sat right on my backside and the waistband wasn't under my armpit- these are benefits worth paying for. And that is one of my points. If they had put these jeans on a table saying that they were originally 54.00 and were now 36.00- I would have thought great deal- however I was put in the uncomfortable position of having to question the price of both items. \nI left with the jeans and a  bad feeling about Kohls- I went to Walmart for underwear.", "2016-10-10T18:57:00+0000", "159616034235_10154722308679236"], ["10154722308679236_10154740422909236", "I worked for them for 17 years and they shut down and took benifits.
